# Module 4 Course 3 Notes

## üìò What You‚Äôll Learn

- Security Hardening
- OS Hardening
- Network Hardening Practices
- Cloud Network Hardening

## üîê What is Security Hardening?

**Security Hardening**: Strengthening a system to reduce vulnerabilities and attack surface.

**Attack Surface**: All potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit.

### Hardening Targets:

- Hardware
- Operating Systems
- Applications
- Networks
- Databases
- Physical Devices & Environments

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Hardening Procedures

- Software patches and updates
- Config changes (e.g., encryption standards)
- Disabling unused apps/services/ports
- Reducing access permissions
- Penetration testing (simulated attacks)

---

## üíª OS Hardening

**OS** = Interface between hardware and software.

### Regular Tasks:

- **Patch Updates**: Fix vulnerabilities ASAP
- **Baseline Configuration**: Compare current state to default secure state
- **Disposal**: Wipe old hardware/software
- **Password Policies**: Strong requirements
- **MFA**: Multi-Factor Authentication

### Attack Prevention:

- **Brute Force Attacks**:

  - **Simple**: Guessing credentials
  - **Dictionary**: Using known/stolen passwords

- **Preventative Tools**:
  - Virtual Machines
  - Sandbox environments
  - Hashing & salting passwords
  - CAPTCHA & reCAPTCHA

---

## üåê Network Hardening

### Regular Tasks:

- Firewall rule updates
- Network log analysis
- Patch updates
- Server backups

### One-Time Setup:

- **Port Filtering**: Only needed ports allowed
- **Access Privileges**
- **Encryption**
- **Network Segmentation**:
  - Isolate departments/zones
  - Limit scope of attacks

### Tools:

- **SIEM** (Security Info & Event Management): Aggregates and analyzes logs from all devices

## üß± Defense in Depth: Network Security Applications

| Tool                                  | Function                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Firewall**                          | Allows/blocks traffic based on rules                |
| **IDS** (Intrusion Detection System)  | Alerts on suspicious activity                       |
| **IPS** (Intrusion Prevention System) | Actively blocks threats                             |
| **SIEM**                              | Collects, visualizes, and prioritizes security logs |

> IDS + Firewall = More defense
> IPS = Proactive stopping of threats
> NGFW = Packet inspection + rule-based filtering

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Hardening

**Cloud Network** = Remote data centers for apps/data.

### Best Practices:

- Server **baseline image** comparison
- Separate sensitive apps/functions
- Cloud log analysis via **flow logs** and **packet mirroring**

### IAM (Identity Access Management):

- Manages digital identities and permissions
- Prevent misconfigured roles

### Other Measures:

- **Encryption** and key management
- **Hypervisors** (Type 1 preferred in CSPs)
- **VM Escape Prevention**
- **Cryptographic Erasure** (Crypto Shredding)
- **TPM/CloudHSM** for secure key storage

---

## üß† Cloud Security Concepts

- **Zero-Day Attacks**: CSPs often detect/respond faster
- **Shared Responsibility Model**:
  - **CSP** secures infrastructure
  - **Customer** secures applications/data/configs

---

## üîë Cryptography in the Cloud

- **Encryption**: Converts data to ciphertext using keys
- **Salting & Hashing**: Secure password storage
- **Key Management**: TPM & CloudHSM
- **Crypto Erasure**: Destroy keys = unreadable data

# 🛡️ Applying the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

The **NIST CSF** (National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework) helps organizations manage cybersecurity risks, implement risk management strategies, and learn from past incidents.

## 🎯 The 5 Core Functions

1. **Identify**
2. **Protect**
3. **Detect**
4. **Respond**
5. **Recover**

These functions help ensure proactive and reactive security strategies, and must be regularly updated to keep pace with evolving threats.

## 🔍 1. Identify

Manage security risks through regular audits of internal systems and access.

### Key Questions:

- **Technology/Asset Management**: Which hardware, OS, and software were affected?
- **Process/Business Environment**: Which business processes were impacted?
- **People**: Who needs access to the affected systems?

---

## 🛡️ 2. Protect

Develop strategies to protect internal assets via policies, training, and tools.

### Key Questions:

- **Access Control**: Who requires access? How is unauthorized access blocked?
- **Awareness/Training**: Who needs to know how to prevent this in the future?
- **Data Security**: Does any data need stronger protection?
- **Procedures**: Are new procedures needed to protect assets?
- **Maintenance**: Do affected systems need updates?
- **Protective Technologies**: Should firewalls or IDS be implemented?

---

## 🧭 3. Detect

Build systems that can detect threats and attacks promptly.

### Key Questions:

- **Anomalies & Events**: What tools (e.g., SIEM) can detect anomalies?
- **Continuous Monitoring**: What IT processes/tools are needed for ongoing monitoring?
- **Detection Process**: What tools (e.g., IDS) can detect security events?

---

## 🛠️ 4. Respond

Develop procedures for responding to incidents and reducing impact.

### Key Questions:

- **Response Planning**: What future action plans are needed?
- **Communications**: How will the response be communicated to users and IT?
- **Analysis**: What analysis steps should follow an attack?
- **Mitigation**: How can impact be minimized (e.g., isolate resources)?
- **Improvements**: How can the response plan be improved?

---

## 🔄 5. Recover

Create and implement plans to restore affected systems and data.

### Key Questions:

- **Recovery Planning**: How will affected systems/resources be restored?
- **Improvements**: What improvements are needed in recovery procedures?
- **Communications**: How will restoration be communicated to stakeholders?

---

## ✅ Summary

The NIST CSF provides a comprehensive framework of both **proactive and reactive** cybersecurity strategies. Organizations that apply the five core functions—**Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover**—can minimize risk and improve resilience after security incidents.

---

## A

- **Active packet sniffing**: A type of attack where data packets are manipulated in transit
- **Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)**: Used to determine the MAC address of the next router or device to traverse

## B

- **Bandwidth**: The maximum data transmission capacity over a network, measured by bits per second
- **Baseline configuration**: A documented set of system specs used for future builds and updates
- **Bluetooth**: Used for wireless communication with nearby physical devices
- **Botnet**: A group of computers infected by malware under a single threat actorâ€™s control ("bot herder")

## C

- **Cloud-based firewalls**: Firewalls hosted by cloud service providers
- **Cloud computing**: Using remote internet-based servers instead of local devices
- **Cloud network**: Internet-accessible infrastructure storing data/resources in remote data centers
- **Controlled zone**: A subnet that protects the internal network from external networks

## D

- **Data packet**: A unit of information transferred across a network
- **Denial of service (DoS) attack**: Overloads a network/server with traffic to disrupt operations
- **Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack**: A DoS attack using multiple devices/locations
- **Domain Name System (DNS)**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses

## E

- **Encapsulation**: VPN-based process that wraps sensitive data in protective packets

## F

- **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**: Transfers files between devices over a network
- **Firewall**: Monitors and controls incoming/outgoing network traffic
- **Forward proxy server**: Regulates a user's access to the internet

## H

- **Hardware**: Physical components of a computer
- **Hub**: Broadcasts data to all devices on the network
- **HTTP**: Protocol for client-server communication on websites
- **HTTPS**: Secure version of HTTP using encryption

## I

- **Identity and access management (IAM)**: Manages digital identities and access rights
- **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)**: Wireless LAN communication standards
- **ICMP**: Reports network transmission errors
- **ICMP flood**: DoS using repeated ICMP requests
- **IP (Internet Protocol)**: Standard for routing and addressing data packets
- **IP address**: Unique identifier for devices on a network
- **IP spoofing**: Fakes IP address to bypass security and impersonate a trusted source

## L

- **Local Area Network (LAN)**: A network in a small physical area (e.g., home, office)

## M

- **MAC address**: Hardware-unique alphanumeric identifier
- **Modem**: Connects router to ISP
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)**: Requires two+ identity verifications to access systems

## N

- **Network**: Group of connected devices
- **Network log analysis**: Examining logs to identify unusual activity
- **Network protocols**: Set of rules for organizing and sending data over networks
- **Network segmentation**: Dividing a network into secure segments

## O

- **Operating System (OS)**: Interface between user and hardware
- **OSI Model**: Conceptual 7-layer network communication model
- **On-path attack**: Attacker intercepts/modifies data between two devices

## P

- **Packet sniffing**: Capturing and inspecting data packets
- **Passive packet sniffing**: Viewing all network traffic without modifying it
- **Patch update**: Software/OS update to fix vulnerabilities
- **Penetration testing**: Simulated attack to identify security weaknesses
- **Ping of death**: DoS using oversized ICMP packets
- **Port**: Software endpoint for network communication
- **Port filtering**: Allow/block data traffic on specific ports
- **Proxy server**: Forwards client requests to other servers

## R

- **Replay attack**: Reuses captured data packets to mimic legitimate users
- **Reverse proxy server**: Regulates external access to internal servers
- **Router**: Directs traffic between different networks

## S

- **SFTP**: Secure file transfer using SSH
- **SSH**: Secure command-line connection to remote systems
- **Security hardening**: Reducing vulnerabilities of a system
- **SIEM**: Centralized log data analysis for security monitoring
- **Security zone**: Network segment separating internal from external systems
- **SNMP**: Manages network devices remotely
- **Smurf attack**: Floods network using spoofed ICMP pings
- **Speed**: Data transmission rate, measured in bits per second
- **Stateful firewall**: Tracks traffic and blocks threats based on behavior
- **Stateless firewall**: Applies static rules without tracking connections
- **Subnetting**: Dividing a network into smaller logical subgroups
- **Switch**: Connects devices and manages data transfers on a network
- **SYN flood attack**: DoS simulating TCP connections to overwhelm servers

## T

- **TCP/IP model**: Four-layer model describing internet communications
- **TCP**: Reliable protocol that establishes a connection before data transfer
- **TCP 3-way handshake**: SYN â†’ SYN/ACK â†’ ACK process to begin TCP connection

## U

- **Uncontrolled zone**: Any part of the network not governed by internal policies
- **UDP**: Fast, connectionless protocol without error-checking

## V

- **VPN**: Encrypts data and hides user IP/location on public networks

## W

- **WAN**: Large-scale network spanning cities/countries
- **WPA**: Wi-Fi security protocol
